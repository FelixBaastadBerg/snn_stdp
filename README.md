# ðŸ§  Unsupervised Time Series Forecasting with Spiking Neural Networks

This project explores the use of **Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)** and **Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP)** for **unsupervised time series forecasting**.  
It was developed as part of my work at MIT (Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science).

The model learns to predict one step ahead in stationary time series data â€” here, **detrended daily temperatures in Madrid** â€” without any supervision.  
The goal is to test whether biologically inspired, unsupervised learning rules can discover meaningful temporal structure in data traditionally modeled by supervised approaches.

## ðŸš€ Overview

- Implements a **biologically inspired learning algorithm (STDP)** using **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons**
- Built using the [**Brian2**](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/) simulator in Python
- Trains an unsupervised spiking network to forecast one-step-ahead values
- Evaluates results using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and compares to **AR(5)** baseline
- Includes visualization of neuron firing activity, receptive fields, and synaptic weight evolution

## ðŸ§© Network Architecture

The architecture is based on **Diehl & Cook (2015)**:
- **Input layer** encodes data as firing rates (Poisson-distributed spike trains)
- **Excitatory layer** learns to represent distinct temporal patterns
- **Inhibitory layer** introduces lateral competition to promote diverse receptive fields  
- Learning occurs locally via the **Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP)** rule

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

- The SNN achieves meaningful temporal forecasting, though MSE remains higher than AR(5)
- The receptive fields form distinct patterns, revealing biologically interpretable neuron behavior
- Performance improves up to an optimal ratio between number of neurons and training data
- The model performs particularly well on **boolean or range-based forecasting** tasks

| Model | MSE (â†“) | Correct Label % (â†‘) |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| AR(5) | 412 | - |
| SNN (1000 neurons) | 670.8 | 18.1% |
